**Magic World**
Magic World is a small ActionRPG, which I am developing at the moment.

This basis of this game was created with the help of an Tutorial by RyiSnow. (Go and check out his channel: https://www.youtube.com/@RyiSnow)

This is my first ever Java Programm. I decided not to use a Game Engine and instead make my own. (I regret this decition)

At the moment the game has neither a story or any interesting gameplay.
